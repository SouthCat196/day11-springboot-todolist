**What did I learn**

1. **Frontend Interceptors:** I learned how to use interceptors to intercept requests and responses for unified processing, such as adding authentication information and handling errors.
2. **Cross-Origin Issues:** I learned the causes of cross-origin issues and the methods to resolve them, such as configuring WebMvc and using the `@CrossOrigin` annotation.
3. **Frontend-Backend Coordination:** I mastered the process of frontend-backend integration, ensuring that requests sent from the frontend correctly reach the backend and that the data returned from the backend is rendered correctly on the frontend.

**I:**

- Today, I studied the implementation of frontend interceptors and their application in requests and responses. I found them to be very important in frontend-backend development, as they help reduce redundant code and improve development efficiency.
- While learning about cross-origin issues, I mastered several common solutions, especially CORS and its configuration methods. I gained an understanding of how to avoid cross-origin problems in a frontend-backend separation development environment.

**D:**

- When learning about interceptors, it's important to practice more and understand how to configure and use interceptors in different scenarios.
- A deep understanding of solving cross-origin issues is essential to ensure that cross-origin problems can be efficiently resolved.
